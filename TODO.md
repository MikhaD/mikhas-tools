# To Do
- Ask or test if Notepad++/Word/Minecraft and any other non default programs are on the hosts computer (Test with run command) Inform user that there are tools that apply to nonexistant programs, and have radio buttons asking whether they want to show those tools anyway. If yes, color them differently in the gui. If it gets installed, change it back, or if hidden, ask if the user now want to show them. If not, have the option available in the settings.
- Write mini keyboard with small translucent dot to enable it, like a phone.
- Remove tool if the program it is intended for does not exist
